Abstract—Smart watches have become potent multimodal 
sensing devices and can continually measure physiological and 
movement measurements (heart rate, SpO 2, accelerator, gy - 
roscope streams). These indicators have a high promise in 
early warning of unfavourable health outcomes and long -term 
health conditions. Nevertheless, the current consumer systems  
are generally retrospective in nature, do not offer customized 
real-time intelligence and are less integrated to support anomaly 
identification, daily health and user -centered behavioral advice. 
To eliminate these shortcomings, the present paper proposes a 
coherent, real-time AI-based model, which turns sensor readings 
of a smartwatch into a smart health monitoring and scheduling 
agent that runs in a web-based PC-based environment. 
The suggested system continuously accepts bio –signal data  
sent by a Samsung Galaxy Watch through Bluetooth Low  
Energy (BLE) and performs all the work on the equipment 
of the user with optimized inference on WebAssembly-based 
and ONNX. A hybrid LSTM–GRU model is used to model 
the temporal patterns to detect abnormalities in real -time and 
identify abnormal physiological patterns early. Simultaneously,  
a health dashboard can be used to visualise live HR, SpO 2, 
activity, stress-like deviations and trends of the day, assisting 
in self -monitoring. In addition to the anomaly detection, the 
system integrates a hybrid scheduling assistant that has rule - 
based logic as well as lightweight personalization modules. This 
assistant gives hydration notifications, sleep schedule suggestions, 
activity notifications, screen -time notifications, and medication 
notifications based on behavioral patterns and daily physiological 
fluctuations. 
Data processing is done on -device, transmission is encry pted 
using BLE and no data is stored on the cloud. The results 
of experimental assessment on the WESAD dataset and live 
smartwatch streams show very good results: a high accuracy of

of less than 1.8 seconds to operate in real -time. These findings

I. INTRODUCTION 
Wearable devices have become multi -functional health - 
monitoring devices that can continuously record multimodal 
health physiological measurements such as heart rate (HR ), 
blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), photoplethysmography 
(PPG), and inertial information. The signals will be very  
useful in getting information about cardiovascular well -being, 
stress, and behavioral pattern. Deep learning has played an 
important role in understanding these physiological time - 
series as noted in the most recent reviews on wearable -based 
health monitoring and sensor analytics These physiological 
time-series have been significant in understanding with the 
latest reviews on wearable-based health monitoring and sensor 
analytics citing the use of deep learning in the latter as 
mentioned in the most recent reviews on wearable-based health 
monitoring and sensor analytics reviews are included in the 
title DeepWearables [2], [3]. Deep neural networks have also 
been useful in modeling physiological variability, especially 
HRV-based stress and anomaly indicators of stress levels and 
characteristics of an individual user [4]. 
The concomitant advancements in anomaly detection in - 
dicate that recurrent models such as LSTM and GRU can  
learn abnormal physiological behaviour during real -time use 
of wearables during anomaly detection tasks and anomaly 
prediction tasks, respectively, as it is demonstrated with respect 
to sleep and pain detection [1]. Meanwhile, modern edge -AI 
implementation software, such as WebAssembly, and ONNX 
Runtime Web, can be used to execute machine learning infer - 
ence directly on web browsers with near -native performance, 
making wearables reachable directly to webAI or via software 
proxies or intermediate hardware, using the ONNX runtime 
Web proxy interface to communicate with the webAI to the 
software stack [7]. Together with the streaming that has been 
implemented with the support of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
[9], these advances allow creating fully local health analytics 
systems without privacy. 
Individualized behavioral guidance is also emphasized in 
digital health studies and has proven to positively influence 
adherence and long -term results in terms of adhe rence to 
behavior change interventions and procedures  [10], [11]. 
Following these tendencies, this work suggests a cohesive, 
browser-based framework that will combine real-time anomaly 
detection and continuous monitoring, as well as individual 
scheduling based on smartwatch data. 
A. Problem Statement 
Despite the fact that new smartwatches have gathers of 
physiological and movement data, current consumer health 
apps are mostly designed to deliver summative views as 
opposed to real -time analysis and proactive su ggestions. The 
regular reports of sleep, heart rate, or activity data tend to reach 
the user on a daily or weekly basis, however, the user is not 
usually alerted to abnormal HR spikes, stress -like responses, 
or irregular motion patterns, until far later on . More than that, 
current wearable ecosystems rarely provide continuous moni - 
toring with personalized behavioral assistance, such as water - 
drinking reminders, sleep reminders, screen-time minimization 
and medication reminders. 
Regarding system, there are  other restrictions. To begin 
with, most of the anomaly detection models are based on 
the cloud -computing model, which makes it questionable in 
terms of privacy, latency, and data ownership [7]. Second, mo- 
tion artifacts make physiological cues (PPG and accelerators 
data) highly susceptible to preprocessing and require robust 
preprocessing and time model strategies Prestige Personality 
Digital [3]. Third, the current scheduling and recommenda - 
tion technologies in digital health are often not contextually  
personalized, meaning that they do not change the reminders 
according to the habits, day-to-day variability, or physiological 
patterns of each user group member [10], [11]. 
With these lapses, the fundamental question that is taken 
care of by this work is: 
How could real-time data of continuous smartwatch 
sensors be converted into a unified and privacy - 
preserving web-based platform capable of real -time 
anomaly detection, continuous health monitoring, 
and personalized hybrid scheduling support? 
In order to  address this challenge, the system proposed 
should: (1) will reliably stream live smartwatch data using 
BLE; (2) real time preprocess and model biosignals; (3) 
perceive low -latency physiological aberrations; (4) provide 
understandable health data in the f orm of a web dashboard; 
and (5) integrate custom scheduling interventions, depending 
on user behaviour. 
B. Contributions 
The paper demonstrates a multifunctional, AI -based wear- 
able health monitoring device, which combines anomaly de - 
tection, live physiology view, and individual scheduling as - 
sistance as an element of privacy -aware web application. The 
main contributions include the following: 
• A smartwatch -to-web real -time streaming pipeline: 
We develop a BLE -based data collection system that 
streams HR, SpO 2, accelerators, and gyroscopes data of  
a Samsung Galaxy Watch to a web interface with low 
latency [9]. 
• A hybrid LSTM –GRU anomaly detector model: A 
deep recurrent architecture, which is optimized to model 
temporal biosignals, is used in the system to detect 
the abnormal physiological patterns of an individual, 
including abnormal HR, abnormal physiological rhythms, 
and stress indicators, among others, with high accuracy 
[1], [2]. 
• A web -based on -device inference engine: Using We - 
bAssembly and ONNX Runtime Web, the entire ML 
pipeline runs locally inside the browser, ensuring user 
privacy, reduced latency, and independence from cloud 
services [7]. 
• A detailed real -time health dashboard: The PC web 
app presents streamlined physiological data, past trends, 
and alerting concerns and helps users monitor health 
indicators, including HR, SpO 2, motion intensity, stress - 
like variability, and overall patterns of daily trends. 
• A hybrid scheduling and wellness assistant: We 
introduce a dual -layer behavioral assistant combining 
rule-based reminders (hydration, sleep, activity, screen - 
time breaks, medication) with lightweight personalization 
modules that adapt notifications based on user habits, 
physiological trends, and past compliance [10], [11]. 
• Evaluation using benchmark and live datasets: Exper- 
iments on the WESAD dataset and live smartwatch data 
demonstrate realistic performance with 90% anomaly de- 
tection accuracy, 35–50 ms inference latency in-browser, 
and end-to-end responsiveness under 1.8 seconds. 
Together, these contributions combined provide a single 
platform, which is capable of transforming wearable health 
monitoring into the active, personalized and privacy respecting 
digital health support. 
II. BACKGROUND 
Wearables have evolved to become sophisticated physio - 
logical sensing systems with the abilities to perform real - 
time health tracking. The smartwatches today combine optical 
sensors to measure photoplethysmography (PPG), electrical 
sensors to measure heart -rate variabi lity (HRV), and inertial 
sensors (accelerators and gyroscopes). Such streams of contin- 
uous data allow measuring cardiovascular behavior, breathing 
patterns, intensity of movements, and physiological responses 
of stress. PPG and HRV signals, along with motion cues, have 
turned out to be powerful predictors of anomalies in the form 
of irregular heart rate variations, stress, and abnormal activity 
rates, as was shown in the recent works [2], [3]. 
Physiological time -series, on the other hand, are subject 
specific and noisy. Signal quality is commonly compromised 
by motion artifacts, variations in illumination, the variation 
in contact with the skin -sensors, and sampling variations. As 
such, real-time surveillance systems need to have a powerful 
filtering, synchronization, and time modeling algorithms to 
generate insightful information. Deep recurring neural net - 
works, especially LSTM and GRU designs have been shown to 
be effective in long-range temporal dependencies on wearable 
data and high -level performance in wearable anomaly detec - 
tion and stress -related prediction tasks [1]. These models are 
currently popular with wearable-based monitoring systems. 
The other significant change in technology is the advent of 
machine learning based on browsers. Recent architectures like 
the WebAssembly (WASM) system or ONNX Runtime Web 
enable deep-learning models to be executed with performance 
in a typical web browser rather than being deployed on the 
cloud, where there is a risk of latency, privacy, and constant 
connectivity problems [7]. This allows local inference on a  
PC of a user, but maintains privacy as well as allowing almost 
native execution speed. 
Communication between the smartwatch and PC is usually 
facilitated by the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). BLE offers 
real-time transmission of heart rate, SpO 2, and motion data at 
moderate battery cost. The current assessment indicates that 
smartwatches have a power consumption of around 5 -8% per 
hour to support real-time streaming applications [9]. The basis 
of constructing reliable real-time monitoring pipelines is based 
on the stable streaming and timestamp alignment. 
Lastly, digital health has continued to support personalised 
behavioural advice. The recent health apps combine physio - 
logical measurements with rule -based or adaptive recommen - 
dation engines to aid in hydration habits, sleep health, drug 
intake, and exercise habits. It has been shown that hybrid 
methods (a combination of regular reminders and personal - 
ization based on the context) result in increased co mpliance 
and long -term habit formation by the user [10], [11]. These 
trends endorse the integration of a light smart scheduler into 
wearable-based monitoring systems. 
Combined, these advancements on wearable sensing, time 
model, on -node inference, BLE -based data collection, and 
personalized digital health constitute the basis of the real 
time, privacy-saving health monitor and schedule framework, 
as suggested in this work. 
III. RELATED WORK 
The current innovations in wearable sensing, physiological 
anomaly detection and browser based machine learning have 
greatly enlarged the potential of real -time health monitoring 
systems. In this section, we review the previous studies 
in five main areas that the development of our proposed 
framework directly relies on: ( 1) physiological sensing and 
digital biomarkers, (2) anomaly detection by deep-learning, (3) 
edge and web -based pipelines, (4) BLE -based real-time data 
acquisition, and (5) personalized digital health and scheduling 
systems. 
A. Physiological Sensing and Digital Biomarkers 
he history of wearable biosensors has already secured PPG, 
HR, HRV and motion cues, as valid digital biomarkers of 
continuous cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring. As it 
was shown by Faust et al. [3] PPG signals and deep learning 
used together are able to identify cardiorespiratory abnormal - 
ities with high accuracy. Charlton et al. aided the review of 
deep learning approaches in the context of wearables, with 
multimodal fusion-based stress, fatigue, and cardiac anomaly 
detection being the most effective ones. [2] The papers high - 
light the potential of these wrist -based sensors to be used in 
real-time physiological monitoring, which is what our sensing 
channels are based on. 
B. Deep Learning for Wearable Anomaly Detection 
Wearable anomaly det ection is a research field that is 
advancing fast. Hossain et al. tested LSTM and GRU models 
to identify abnormal heart and activity patterns using HRV and 
accelerator records [1]. Their results demonstrate that recurrent 
networks are better than classical  ML techniques in learning 
temporal dependencies in motion noise. Recently, Guo et 
al. proposed transformer -based stress sensors and anomaly 
classifiers, transformer -based wearable stress and anomaly 
classifiers that apply better to long -range dependencies  but 
with greater computation cost [5]. These lessons inform us 
in selecting a hybrid recurrent model (LSTM -GRU) that is 
low-latency optimized on web platforms. 
C. Edge Computing and Browser-Based Inference 
Edge computing and Browser -Based Inference Edge com - 
puting is primarily meant to make computers and devices 
outside the datacenters useful in the development, training  
and testing of machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
Conventional cloud-reliant analytics have privacy limitations, 
latency limitations and connectivity limitations. Luo et al. [7] 
demonstrated that machine learning (through WebAssembly 
and ONNX runtime Web) via a browser can reach near-native 
inference through deep models with nearly no modification. 
The implications of their results  are that it is possible to 
execute complex models on client devices without server 
processing, and this fits in with our real -time web applica - 
tion architecture. Other assessments of deep-learning models 
deployed on the web support t he feasibility of private, fast,  
and entirely client inference. 
D. BLE Streaming and Real-Time Monitoring Stability 
Having a dependable real -time physiological surveillance 
entails uniform data transmission of the wearable device. The 
article by Singh et al. [9] emade a comparison of BLE- 
based continuous streaming and demonstrated that the latest 
smartwatch devices could offer multi -sensor streaming with 
low packet loss rates and satisfactory battery consumption. 
Such findings justify the choice of BLE as the  main transport 
protocol to be used in HR, SpO2, and motion data transmission 
during the processing of real-time web applications. Our jitter 
compensation and timing synchronization are also informed 
with their findings. 
E. Personalized Digital Health and Scheduling Systems 
Health platforms based on wearable continue to integrate 
behavioral support technologies like warnings, customized 
interventions, and habit-forming technologies. Peiris et al. [10] 
revealed that hybrid digital interventions, which are a combina- 
tion of fixed -interval reminders and adaptive personalization, 
enhance the habit adherence and the long-term behavioral out- 
comes .Zhao et al. [11] proved that it is effective to implement 
ML-based recommendation engines in the context of providing 
health recommendations based on the use of physiological  
and behavioral data. These researches support the idea that 
a smart scheduling assistant should be incorporated into our 
architecture so that users could be provided with customized 
lifestyle prom pts based on the state of their physiological 
condition as well as their daily schedule. 
F. Summary of Research Gaps 
Concisely, it is important to highlight the research gaps in 
this study as follows: Although earlier research possesses solid 
backgrounds in physiological sensing, anomaly detection and 
customized health recommendation systems, they do not study 
them comprehensively in most instances. Few existing works 
unify: 
1) real-time BLE streaming from a smartwatch, 
2) inference with browser-based deep-learning, and no de - 
pendence on the cloud, 
3) continuous detection of physiological abnormalities, 
4) and a customized scheduling managerial incorporated in 
the same platform. 
This gap stimulates the development of our end-to-end system 
that integrates these elements into one privacy-aware web ap- 
plication of real-time health monitoring and custom behaviour 
support. 
IV. METHODOLOGY 
This section is the full design of the proposed system 
of health monitoring and anomaly detection in real-time. 
In contrast to classical cloud -based pipelines, everything is 
computed locally in the web browser of the user, such as data 
acquisition, preprocessing, model inference and visualization. 
The sensor data of Smartwatch are transmitted in the form of 
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) streams, processed in real-time, 
sent to an ONNX -deployed LSTMGRU hybrid model, which 
is implemented on the WebAssembly and displayed on a live 
dashboard. An intelligent, personalized scheduling assistant, 
through anomaly detection, is supplemented w ith intelligent 
behavioral suggestions and reminders. 
A. System Overview 
The overall system architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1.The 
pipeline will be made up of four layers: 
1) Data Acquisition Layer: Smartwatch data retrieval with 
Web Bluetooth (BLE). 
2) Preprocessing Layer: Noise Filters, normalization, seg- 
mentation, and feature extractors. 
3) Inference Layer: LSTM–GRU hybrid model executed 
using ONNX Runtime Web and WebAssembly acceler - 
ation [7]. 
4) User Interaction Layer: Real-time dashboard, anomaly 
notifications, and customized scheduling support. 
It is all local with minimal latency and high privacy rates  
of operations in place. [9].

B. Datasets 
Two datasets were taken to develop and evaluate the models: 
• WESAD [12]:Multimodal data (PPG, ECG, accelerome- 
try, EDA, and respiration) in multimodal format. It offers 
training labels to supervised training. 
• Live Smartwatch Streams :s This is the data of Sam - 
sung Galaxy Watch HR, HRV proxies, SpO2, accelerator 
and gyroscope, which has been recorded to ensure the 
practicality of BLE throughput, latency and dashboard 
reactiveness. 
Such a combination guarantees the quality of supervised 
training and reasonable deployment testing.

C. Real-Time Data Acquisition and Synchronization 
The procedure of acquiring and synchronizing real-time data 
is known as real-time data acquisition and synchronization. 
Sensor data streaming takes place over BLE GATT char - 
acteristics over the Web Bluetooth API. BLE packets can 
be received at different times, so the synchronization can be 
achieved using the following strategies: 
• Timestamp alignment: Device timestamps are used to 
align multisensor readings. 
• Gap compensation: Linear interpolation Linear interpo - 
lation is used when gaps between packets are less than 
200 ms. 
• Sliding windowing : Signals are buffered in 5 -second 
windows overlapped by 50%. 
Monitored throughput matches with the normal smartwatch 
BLE rates (85–90 Hz for motion sensors and about ∼1 Hz for 
HR/SpO2) [9]. 
D. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 
hese processes process the information in data and impose 
operations on it to enhance the outcome of the following 
classification step. Raw wearable signals are vulnerable to 
noise, motion artifact as well as user variability. Preprocessing 
pipeline represented in Fig. 2, processes: 
• bandpass filtering with a 5th-order Butterworth filter (0.5 
- 12 Hz), 
• Normalization using z-score or min–max scaling, 
• Window segmentation (5 s, 50% overlap), 
• Time-domain and  spectral feature extraction (RMSSD, 
entropy, dominant frequency, energy). 
All the operations are implemented on WebAssembly ker - 
nels, and preprocessing time remains less than 10 ms. 
E. LSTM–GRU Hybrid Model Architecture 
The LSTM -GRU Hybrid Model Architecture is a sub - 
section of the original LSTM Model Architecture, which is 
a hybrid between the LSTM and GRU models. 
The model is a combination of LSTM layers (to provide 
long-range temporal modeling) and GRU layers (to provide 
computing efficiency). The architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 3, 
includes: 
• Two LSTM layers (64 units each), 
• Two GRU layers (64 units each), 
• Dropout (0.3), 
• Dense softmax output. 
WESAD is used to train the model offline and is deployed 
as an ONNX model running with WebAssembly [7].

F. Real-Time Inference Pipeline 
This section outlines the pipeline the project will make use 
of in order to generate real-time predictions. 
These steps are followed in the real-time inference flow 
which is depicted in Fig. 4: 
1) Convert feature vector to ONNX tensor, 
2) LSTM–GRU model: run on WebAssembly, 
3) Generate anomaly probability score, 
4) Apply adaptive thresholding, 
5) refresh browser dashboard and generate alerts. 
Consumer devices have an end-to-end latency that is less 
than 100 ms.

G. Personalized Scheduling Assistant 
The scheduling assistant will offer: 
• Distinct reminders (hydration, breaks, medication), 
• Adaptive instructions according to the physiological pat- 
terns, 
• Behaviour–inspired updates based on the guidelines of 
digital health studies [10], [11]. 
H. Privacy-Preserving Architecture 
The sensor acquisition, pre-processing, inference, and visu- 
alization is done locally in the browser environment. None of 
the data move out of the device of user. The sandbox ing of 
WebAssembly and the dealing with BLE permissions are other 
added safety features of WebAI [7].

The diagrams  1–4 depict the entire privacy -sensitive 
browser pipeline of real -time smartwatch-based anomaly de - 
tection and scheduling. 
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This part assesses the functionality of the proposed real-time 
anomaly detector and health monitoring system on a personal 
computer (PC) as a Web -based web application. All the 
computations, such as the preprocessing and feature extraction 
and model inference, were performed locally within the web 
browser with WebAssembly-optimized ONNX inference. The 
test was done on a standard desktop computer with Intel Core 
i5 processor and 8 GB RAM which is a typical end -user 
hardware. 
A. Anomaly Detection Performance 
The hybrid LSTM–GRU model proved to be highly strong 
in terms of its temporal modeling both on the benchmark 
and real world data. The model recorded an accuracy of 
95.8%, F1-score of 0.94, and AUC–ROC of 0.97 on the 
WESAD dataset. In the real world data of Galaxy Watch4, 
the model achieved an accuracy of 93.4% with the F 1 -score 
of 0.91. Such results align with previous literature studies 
indicating that recurrent neural networks, especially LSTM 
and GRU models, are useful at learning physiological time- 
series dynamics to detect anomalies in wearables [1], [2], [4]. 
The system also uses the adaptive thresholding to customize 
the conditions of the anomaly boundaries according to user- 
specific trends to enhance practical performance. Adaptive 
thresholds classified fewer false positives by 18.6% and false 
negatives by 12.1%, compared to a universal threshold, which 
is consistent with the fact that individualized modeling can 
detect physiological anomalies better than universal modeling 
can [4]. 
B. Robustness to Motion Artifacts 
PPG and accelerator streams are also wearable and therefore 
are extremely sensitive to motion artifacts. In the high -motion 
case, accuracy in detecting anomalies was negatively impacted 
by close to 9% when no correction was done. In response 
to this, the system uses bandpass filtering, normalization, and 
accelerated-assisted artifact suppression-methodologies, which 
are consistent with signal-processing approaches suggested 
in the existing literature [3], [6]. Following the application 
of artifact mitigation, the system obtained an accuracy of 
94.1% on the segmentation of motion -intensive ones, which 
proves that the preprocessing pipeline effectively conserves 
physiological data, as well as eliminates noise. 
C. Real-Time Inference on a Web Application 
One of the key objectives of this work is the possibility 
to learn in real time and make inferences directly into the 
browser, without cloud dependency. The hybrid LSTMGRU 
model has a size of about 1.02 million parameters, which 
is client-side WebAssembly executable. ONNX Runtime Web 
inferred at average latency: 
• 28 ms to infer the model in 5 seconds window, 
• 1.6 seconds average response time and preprocessing and 
dashboard update. 
Such findings have been supported in WebAssembly-based 
deep learning studies where browser -side inference can reach 
native performance levels of deep learning models that are na- 
tively executed on the CPU side of the magic mirror model [7]. 
The architecture has provided maximum user privacy as no 
physiological information are exited out of the user device. 
D. Health Monitoring and Scheduling Assistant Evaluation 
he system also offers behavioral scheduling assistant that 
is inbuilt in the dashboard. Its effectiveness was tested in 10  
participants in a 7-day usability study. Participants rated: 
• Health-trend summaries at 4.6/5 to be clear and useful, 
• Daily reminders (hydration, movement, medication) as a 
useful or highly useful in 82% of responses, 
• Routine compliance increased by 23.4% because of adap- 
tive recommendations.

before [10], [11].

the subsections above, and present a summary of these findings

F. Discussion 
The experiment has validated the fact that the suggested 
system is efficient in the real-time, non-invasive physiological 
anomaly detection with consumer -level smartwatches. The 
hybrid LSTMGRU model offers excellent time modeling capa- 
bilities, whereas the motion-artifact mitigation model stabilizes 
the performance in real-life conditions. Notably, the web-based 
implementation provides uncomplicated accessibility without 
installations, user privacy and in-built behavioral support. Con- 
sequently, the system shifts to more advanced digital health 
companion rather than the standardized anomaly detection. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study introduces a workable, AI-based design of real- 
time detection of physiological abnormalities based on the 
continuous sensor data of consumer wearable gadgets like 
the Samsung Galaxy Watch4. The hybrid LSTM–GRU model 
suggested successfully recognizes the false deviations to indi- 
vidual baseline patterns of multimodal biometric streams, such 
as heart rate, SpO2 and motion signals, with high sensitivity 
and low latency. Experimental testing ascertains the possibility 
of the system to reach both 93-95% uncovering accuracy 
and sub-2-second total processing lag end-to-end, which is 
adequate to apply in real world preventive medical procedures. 
The major advantage of this system is its privacy-preserving 
design: all preprocessing, feature extraction and inference 
functions are directly performed in the local browser alongside 
WebAssembly and ONNX Runtime Web. This means that 
the sensitive physiological data can never move out of the 
device, which provides great secureness to privacy threats that 
generally come with cloud reliance. 
The findings show that there is a possibility of turning 
consumer wearables into proactive digital health helpers who 
can sense anomalies early and monitor continuously and pro - 
vide customized behavioral guidance. Other than identification 
of anomalies, the system architecture can be expanded to  
areas like stress and fatigue predictions, and ongoing health 
management. 
Future Work: Several research directions can further en - 
hance this system: 
• nclusion of other biosignals including ECG, skin tem - 
perature and galvanic skin response to provide a mor e 
physiological context. 
• Federalization and transfer learning to the development of 
users without centralization of data Federated and transfer 
learning to enhance personalization without centralization 
of user data. 
• The ability to include context -aware ad aptive feedback, 
which allows automatic recommendations or clinical 
warnings of detected anomalies. 
• On-device inference Optimization to ultra-low-power em- 
bedded execution so that it can be deployed directly on 
wearables or independent devices into the IoT. 
To conclude, this paper provides the basis of smart, safe, 
and real -time physiological analytics on consumer -century 
wearables, the area between raw sensor measurements and 
actionable health metrics.
